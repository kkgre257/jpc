    <h2>What Our Customers Say</h2>
    <p>"Tim Jones and his son arrived soon after I called for an emergency repair.  For a good price, they quickly fixed my broken toilet water feed.  Upon my request, they also fixed a leaky faucet, replaced four broken shutoff valves, and installed a new main water shutoff valve.  Replacement parts appear superior to what was previously in place, and all new valves turn smoothly.  Tim worked efficiently, and was a pleasure to converse with.  He and his son donned shoe booties while in my home, and removed them before going outside or into my concrete floor basement.  I highly recommend Jones Plumbing!" - Emmanuel L.</p>
    <p>"I highly recommend Jones Plumbing. Every time I have used their service the price has been fair and the service has been extraordinary. I would give 6 stars if I could." - Bryan K.</p>
    <p>"Tim was incredibly responsive, friendly, professional, and honest.  He fixed our sump pump within hours of calling and was very thorough and gave good advice.  Strongly recommend, will be our new "go-to" plumber!" - Matt C.</p>
    <p>"I've used him twice.  Excellent and professional work quality.  I called Sunday and he was here early Monday.  Will use him every time.  So far installed pressure sump pump and water heater. He just repaired a gas leak.  Most plumbers don't know how to handle this problem.  But he knew exactly what to do and waited till national fuel came to ensure everything was fine.  Another plumber tried to get me to replace all the plumbing for thousands." - Zenaida P.</p>
    <p>"I was very satisfied with Jones Plumbing. I will refer him to everyone and continue to use his services. He was very pleasant and everything was completed in a timely fashion." - Bill M.</p>
